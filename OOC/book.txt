ASSIGNMENT NO: 06
Problem Statement:
Implement file handling and File input output operations in C++
Create “BOOK.txt” file.
 Put some text in the file created above
Develop an object-oriented program in C++ to writes data to a file, reads it back, and
displays the content in other file,Write a function in C++ to count the number of
uppercase alphabets,to count letters present in a file, to count digits present in a file, to
count white spaces present in a file, to count vowels present in a file using the file
pointer concept.
Objectives:
1. To learn concepts of stream and file.
2. To learn stream classes
3. To learn File I/O with Member Functions.
4. Explain concept file pointer.
Theory:
Explain following concepts
Stream
Stream classes
Different functions and modes for file handling
Algorithm:
Write algorithm here.
Platform: 64 –bit Open source Linux
Input: writing to the file
Output: reading from the file and displays it.
Conclusion: Hence, I learned about different types of file handling functions
FAQs: write answers
1) What are the types of stream
2) Draw the Hierarchy of Stream classes
3) Explain the concept of file pointer
